Being a ISO company have not seen such  inefficient managers and stuffs . No ISO can tackle them . They thinks them as Govt officer , everyday they try to exploit customer. Have seen each of my visit to their office full of chaos with agitating customer and one of their managers. More over, they do exist in each property society and hold unanimous power to modify, alter structure and poke their nose in all sort of society activity. They think money is all and they have money so they can do whatever .Be aware may be company holders are good but managers and stuffs are pain in wrong place. They make all sorts of effort to ruin your Dream . Still their projects are called "Dream " they are indeed Dream F.

Jain Group -creator of Dream Projects in Kolkata is very unprofessional company in real estate. I think the ISO certification is just an eye wash for the customer. Their promises are really made in heaven and only thing they know to right big emails with full of promises. I would just say one thing '' Do not buy any property of Jain Group''. They are most unethical real estate builder I made a deal with. They are even worst than local builder. One of the Jain Group Victim Customer

Jain Group..with lot of false promises named almost all of their projects starting with "Dream".. like, Dream Residency, Dream apartment, Dream excellency.. whereas it should be "Nightmare" in place of "Dream". They failed in every section of a gated community.. right from approach road to their projects, Electrical genset, construction quality, full of idiots and liars in management staff including the so called CEO..Rishi Jain, Yash Jain. Please be aware of any investment or if you think of living here.. Courtesy.. One of the many distressed Dream Resident.. KD.
