 Assotech builder is constructing my studio apartment in Bhubaneswar for more than last 4.5 years..Yet no sign of delivery.Highly unprofessional and unreliable and don't go by their promises..

 My sister has purchased a 2Bhk flat for 47 lakhs from assotech noida. When we shifted to that flat we were very disappointed by the all interior work done in washroom, bedroom and kitchen. They had done very pathetic kind of work.tiles were not fixed up properly.all the walls have been painted up without putty which is giving problems to us.there are two almirahs in the bedrooms but the quality of the plywood used is very low.Kitchen work is so disappointing that we have to call a wood masson for repairing it agian. Although assotech provides good location to their house buyers.i am very disappointed by assotech.

 Now a days there are hundreds of builders and it is very tough to buy a house from that builder who will provide you possession at the right time and all neccesary requirements.we have also purchased a flat for 40 lakhs in noida from assotech developers.they are trustable developers upto some limit.before 2 year ago a agreement was done that they will provide us our possession on 2015.they were late but in 2016 they have provided our posession  to us.when we shifted to our flat we were very happy all the work done in flat was very good.high quality rawmaterial was used in kitchen and bedrooms almirah.they have also given us one chimney in kitchen, one AC, a jhummer with music system in bedroom and one led tv .all the towers in the society are builted in a gap so there is enough space in the society for roaming.there are also many parks for childrens.and staff is also coperative.
