 I heard about mapsko first time through newspaper advertisement.the offer provided by them for their new project casa bella was very reasonable. After checking the official site I decided to meet mapsko builders sales team. The team was very cooperative to me while solving my queries. They also showed me some of the ready flats so that I can convince myself properly before buying the flat. Every basic amenities that I wanted in the flat is available in their flats. But one problem I faced was the metro connectivity to the flats. It took almost one hour to reach to flats as the metro station was not near.

 I purchased my apartment in Mount Ville project built up by Mapsko Group. My apartment is really spacious with all basic amenities built in a very modern way. The best part is its balcony view. Beside this the lift facility is very convinient. I really liked the way it has been constructed.I feel that it was a good decision to buy my dream home from a reliable real estate company like Mapsko Group situated in Gurgaon.

 Mapsko is good builder in gurgaon providing best facilities in all the projects. My family  bought Property at mapsko Casa bella 3 bhk apartment. All amenities provided are world class. excellent customer support provided to us. I recomend this builder to chose for your future investments for dream home. I am planning to invest in one more property with same builder. Another project  Mapsko Mount Ville, Sector 79, Gurgaon is also a good option.

 I am really happy with Mapsko Group and I feel that this is one of the most genuine company in the real estate world. I have purchased a 3BHK apartments in Royal Ville from this company and it is one of the best deals that I have made in my life. The best part about this apartment is that it is quite spacious.Surroundings of the project is also nice. This project is covering a wide area with full of basic amenities.

 Mapsko group is very dedicated in working and give the best quality apartment with modern amenities. we bought Property at mapsko Casa bella 3 bhk apartmentThe interior design is awesome. Their customer support and technical support is just excellent. Sales team are too good.me and my family are very happy.

 I bought an apartment in mapsko casa bella few months ago from mapsko group and today I can say that I had made a right choice.The apartment that I bought is completely spacious and equipped with good facilities.Plus points of this project is that it gives the panorama view of gurgaon from the top floor. This builder provides the modular apartment which includes wooden floor, modular kitchen etc.As per my review mapsko group is good and genuine builders in gurgaon

 Sales team of mapsko group is highly cooperative towards its customers. As I am purchasing an apartment for the first time, so they guided me a lot.They explain all necessary requirements like documents needed at the time of possession of apartment, different type of loans etc.Also they helped to search apartment according to my budget. Also they have provided me the facility to visit  the apartment so that I can check each and everything about the apartment. I booked a flat in royale ville and I am satisfied with this project.

 I was bit scared and confused about choosing the best real estate developers to buy  a commercial property for my buisness.But when I heard about the mapsko group, it made really surprised as the deal they were offering for the commercial property was very good. A decade of experience, in creating top noitch commercial and resdential properties, speaks a lot about the company. And after visiting the site personally, I liked the location and the surroundings also. The property that I bought was totally redesigned by Mapsko Group to make that property earthquake resistant. Moreover the location of the property is very good as it is surrounded by greenry.

 I was living in Delhi with my family and want to move gurgaon permanently as because my office was in gurgaon. But we were confused about whether we should search home by own or should approach a real estate builder. But my friend suggested to approach the real estate builder also he suggested to visit mapsko group at once. While searching over through the net about the mapsko and their projects, I like them very much and decided to visit at mapsko group office.After lots of discussion with the sales team we decided to visit one of their projects Mount Ville.When we reach over there I was so amazed to see their infrastructure as it was so nice and also it as totally matched with the images that I saw on internet. They provided us a lot of time to introspect the apartment which we want to buy. After doing introspection for around 3 hours we decided to buy apartment in Mount Ville. Payment process was also completed very easily. Now today I realized that the decision I made was right and I am happy to choose mapsko group
